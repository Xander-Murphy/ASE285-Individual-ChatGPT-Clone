# Chat285 - Individual Project

## Team Members

- **Xander** (Team Leader)

## Project Description

  Chat285 is made to be a real-time AI Chatbot replicating the core functionality of ChatGPT. Users interact with OpenAI in our custom web application style. This project
  is built on Node, React, Express, and WebSockets.

## Problem Domain

  As the world continues to evolve everything is expected to be done faster and people
  are expected to know more things on a base level. Chat285 helps its users solve these
  problems by giving them access to a wealth on information in a conversational form
  through our custom interface.
